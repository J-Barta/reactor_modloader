# Reactor Modloader

A Modloader for MoSimulator, the FRC driving simulator.

# Running Mods
Downloading and running mods is as easy as launching the app, going to the mods page (second in the menu) and hitting download on one of the mods! Once downloaded, you should be able to play the mod just by hitting the play button. No account, email, or password necessaary!

# Posting Mods
Simply create an account (the third page in the menu). Once you verify your email, you're good to create a mod. Use the "Create Mod" menu to fill out details about your mod, upload a thumbnail, and specify where the executable files for different platforms are (only one platform is needed).

If you run into bugs with using the app, posting mods, etc., please create a [Github issue](https://github.com/J-Barta/reactor_modloader/issues).

If you need support, please send an email to mosimmodloader@gmail.com.
